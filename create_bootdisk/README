# HOW TO BUILD NETCUBE INSTALL IMAGE

in all examples <os version> translaets to: "ubuntu\ 22.04"
this is only a refference to the folder in unattended_install

## STEP 1
download an install medium and put in the same folder as this readme
example: wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso

## STEP 2
for the led and uefi settings to be manipulated during install, a few libs need to be installed
these need to be gathered and placed in the appropriate folder
this is done by running the command: 
./unattended_install/<os version>/nocloud/deps/download_packages.sh

## STEP 3
during install it is requireed that internet is not needed and so some packages need to be supplied in a local repository
this repo is filled by running the following command
./get_packages.sh unattended_install/<os version>/local_repo/

## STEP 4 OPTIONAL
when using -C in step 5 images need to be placed in the ./unattended_install/images folder
these are meant to be qcow2 images that need to be run as vm, this allows for fast deployment on low bandwith links

## STEP 5
create an image by running the following command (not specifying a target only creates the image file, otherwise the image will be written to that device using dd):
```
./create_bootdisk [-t|--target] [-C]

        -t, --target:  /dev/<dev> (target device)
        -C, --copyimages
```

When images has been created, the script waits for keyinput before closing mounts and cleaning up, this allows for easy cuomizations and validation
